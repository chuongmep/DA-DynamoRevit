## Sample content
This sample input executes the `GetProjectCounts.dyn` graph once and the `GetCategoryParameters.dyn` graph twice with two different inputs. After execution, APS returns a download link containing a `result.zip` file that includes the following:

- a graphResult.json for each graph execution
- a ProjectCounts.csv that includes the categories, families and types of each instance.
- a Category-Parameters.csv for each run of the "GetCategoryParameters" graph.
